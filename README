==Backbone File Explorer==

The idea is to make a very lightweight Backbone-based JavaScript file
explorer. It is can be used with server-side scripts that will relay
the server directory structure as JSON. It can be gradually rendered,
using data pulled by AJAX calls, so a very large directory can be
navigated without requiring it to be rendered in its entirety in the
browser (and using up memory).

===Usage===

Each file explorer container must have a CSS ID.
